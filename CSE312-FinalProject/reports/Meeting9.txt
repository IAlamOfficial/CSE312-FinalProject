Problems:
---> Getting docker to work with Maven and JDK
---> Implementing the data base for accounts
---> Finding motivation in this group
---> We neglected our CSE 305 project while working on this. We're giving that project some love rn. Well be back next week.

Notes:
---> Hopefully Nick and I can get docker working

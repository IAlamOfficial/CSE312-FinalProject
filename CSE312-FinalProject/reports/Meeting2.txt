Problems:
---> We don't understand why we should be working on Front End first, especially since the code is prone to changes and if anything
is changed afterwards (e.g. format or simply variable names) then the whole css becomes problematic. Therefore we have not put too
much into Front End presentation and is more likely to make Front End edits towards the end of the project.

Notes:
---> Fixed working Github Java Project in Eclipse by creating new Github Link
---> Old Github Link (to show each member had completed their tasks) : https://github.com/Kat324/CSE312-SocialMediaProject.git
---> Changed theme to fit our attitudes towards this semester
---> Created base Html and Css files

# CSE312-FinalProject
CSE 312 Social Media Project
Description: This a Social Media Project created by a group of 4 encompassing the use of User Accounts, Live Sharing of Multimedia Content Between Users, and User Response to User-Submitted Content (consists of Voting, Commenting, and Direct Messaging).
Goal: In the user's perspective they will be allowed to create social content based on similar media platforms (including Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit). The monochromatic theme enforces the idea of a passing college phase of peace and depression (although this may or will change based on future purposes).
